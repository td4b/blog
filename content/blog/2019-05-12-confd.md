# Using confd to bootstrap docker files.

I have actually seen very little documentation or blog posts about the use of confd. Being able to spin up immutable infrastructure at it's core requires the ability to automate the configuration process on the running container filesystem as well as the host os.To be honest I am new myself to confd, and as I worked on building new security tools, I realized the need for an additional layer of boostraping functions where userdata alone would not cut it.The main benefit I see with confd is the ability to use AWS Secure Token Service to Assume an IAM Role and retrieve remote secrets from Amazon's System Manager Parameter store. These can then be used to update secrets in config files for running container services as well as initially boostrap the host os.

For this blog post I will use a quick and dirty examples to get going, but confd can be used in many different ways to yield awesome results. First lets check out the baseline Terraform template used to deploy our containerlinux (CoreOS) host.

<style type="text/css">
  .gist {width:800px !important;}
  .gist-file
  .gist-data {max-height: 500px;max-width: 800px;}
</style>

Baseline Terraform template
<script src="https://gist.github.com/td4b/4963b61e18e579ca1a39c95c963e648b.js"></script>

This is essentially a one shot script, you could make it clean by setting up modules and such.

In summary it creates the necessary SecurityGroups, IAM Roles, Instance Profiles as well as sets up the systemd units and necessary config template files on the host os. It also creates a spot instance request because, you know, I'm cheap!

The way this is set up is a little advanced in terms of docker and it's interface to the config files. Essentially what I set up is a systemd unit that starts the confd as a container service that mounts into the host filesystem to retrieve the configuration files. After this happens, confd uses ssm as a backend to populate the config file secrets and then finally pushes them out to the volume path locations. This is primarily defined through the toml file specification.

Sample Config file (docker auth).
{{< highlight json >}}
}
        "auths": {
                "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
                        "auth": "{{getv "${loc}"}}"
                }
        }
}
{{< /highlight >}}
Sample toml file for Docker auth.

{{< highlight bash >}}
[template]
src = "login.conf.tmpl"
dest = "/root/.docker/config.json"
keys = [
    "/dev/dockerlogin",
]
{{< /highlight >}}

After launching the terraform script I ssh'ed into the CoreOS box to confirm the secrets have been pushed from SSM parameter store.

That's it! The full terraform config template can be viewed here!
